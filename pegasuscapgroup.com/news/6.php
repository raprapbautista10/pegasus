Pegasus Capital Group and Gladstone Investment Corporation (NASDAQ: GAIN) today announced they have acquired Jackrabbit Inc. along with its Dakota AG Welding division. Based in Ripon, CA, Jackrabbit is an industry leading manufacturer of nut harvesting and other agricultural equipment.

Established in 1981, Jackrabbit Inc. has cultivated an outstanding name and reputation domestically and abroad. The innovative company has pioneered and improved a number of award-winning harvesting machines which are now standard in the nut farming industry. Jackrabbit's machines are staple products in almond, walnut and pecan harvesting, while Dakota's self-propelled pruning towers and laser cutting and forming services expand its reach into crop industries, including cherries and avocados.

Bob DeMont, a longtime resident of the Central Valley, will be joining the Jackrabbit and Dakota team as the new President during this exciting period of growth for the company. Bob, a West Point graduate with advanced degrees from Stanford, not only has experience in a variety of industries, including wine & spirits, injection molding and equipment manufacturing, but also runs a small family farm and understands the challenges facing the Ag industry. He said "I have always admired Jackrabbit and Dakota's focus on innovation and growers needs, and I'm excited to begin this new phase with such a great team. My goal is to continue Earl's legacy of building innovative solutions for growers.

Former majority owner and CEO, Earl Anderson, said "I strongly believe, based on my interactions with Gladstone, Pegasus and Bob DeMont throughout this process, that they will be great stewards of Jackrabbit and Dakota going forward. You will be able to count on the same high quality products and passionate level of honesty, integrity and service from the Jackrabbit and Dakota personnel that you have come to expect from your past dealings with our company."

Patrick Whelan, Managing Partner at Pegasus said "We are delighted to be partnering with Jackrabbit and Dakota's high-quality management team, suppliers and customers as well as Gladstone and Bob DeMont. We are excited to embark on a new chapter of innovation and growth in the dynamic nut and agricultural markets we serve."

Chris Daniel, Managing Director at Gladstone, said "Gladstone Investment is pleased to partner with both Pegasus and the talented management team at Jackrabbit and Dakota. We look forward to building on Jackrabbit's brand and long-standing success by continuing to grow the business."
