In conjunction with Prospect Capital Corporation (“Prospect Capital”) and Stewart Capital Management, Pegasus Capital Group (“Pegasus”), is pleased to announce the $39.8 million recapitalization of Ajax Rolled Ring & Machine (“Ajax”), a custom forger of seamless rolled steel rings.

Ajax operates two ring rolling mills and provides value-added services including engineering, heat treating, shot blasting and machining. The rolled rings are used in construction equipment and in machinery for military, power-generation, petrochemical and industrial applications. Ajax manufactures its products in a 140,000 square-foot facility located in York, South Carolina.

Prospect Capital, a mezzanine debt and equity firm, provided $39.8 million in first- and second-lien debt and equity for the transaction. The equity interest in Ajax was purchased from Dogwood Equity, a private equity firm based in North Carolina. Senior managers of Ajax also invested in the transaction.
