Pegasus Capital Group ("Pegasus") is pleased to announce the sale of its interest in SPG International, LLC ("SPG" or the "Company") to the Company. The transaction was led by the Company's President and CEO, Steven E. Darnell. SPG was successfully carved out of Leggett & Platt, Inc. (NYSE: LEG) after the senior management team and Pegasus acquired it in 2010.
SPG, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, is the leading single-source provider of storage solutions to the foodservice, retail and industrial material handling industries. The Company's superior and customizable product offerings, coupled with its excellent customer service, have enabled it to win premium international accounts in the restaurant, grocery, retail and industrial markets.
Patrick Whelan, Managing Partner at Pegasus, said, "We are very satisfied with the progress we made in partnership with Steve Darnell and SPG's impressive management team, who have proven themselves time and again over our investment period. Once a division of Leggett & Platt, Inc., the Company is now a thriving standalone leader in its industry. This has been a highly successful investment for our firm and we wish the SPG team a very bright future." "We thank Pegasus for all of their contributions to our success," commented Steve Darnell. "We look forward to taking the next step in our Company's evolution, made possible by the efforts of everyone involved in growing the company since 2010."

The firm draws on the expertise of its affiliated network of operators, who have successfully led and advised companies with revenues ranging from $10 million to $300 million. Pegasus' transactions provide liquidity for individual owners, their families, outside investors and corporate owners. It has completed acquisitions across the country and considers investment opportunities located anywhere in the United States and Canada. Pegasus' current portfolio consists of numerous profitable companies in a variety of industries.
