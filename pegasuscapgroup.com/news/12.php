Off to the Races
It looks like M&A professionals ought to quit their day jobs and move to Las Vegas.  If you had wagered that corporate divestiture activity in 2010 would be on the rise, right now you’d be wishing you had bet the farm.  Last year in two separate polls, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and KPMG LLP (KPMG), together with The Deal LLC (The Deal), surveyed nearly 600 industry professionals regarding both overall M&A activity and divestiture volume in 2010.  Not only did respondents foresee a rise in the volume of deal activity, but divestitures were predicted to be a larger slice of the M&A pie.  Those predictions have been confirmed.

Divestitures are often difficult transactions to close, but the benefits can outweigh the challenges.  Despite the arduous process, divestitures are increasing as corporations refocus their core operations and buyers perceive attractive investment opportunities. 

Predicting the winner
Recently, KPMG and The Deal surveyed M&A professionals from both public and private companies, as well as private equity funds.  Approximately 70% said they were more optimistic about the deal environment in 2010.  PricewaterhouseCoopers also surveyed 215 C-suite and corporate development executives from public and private companies, as well as private equity/venture capital professionals to gauge the expected deal environment, specifically in the divestiture arena.  Admittedly, this is partially due to the glut of companies waiting to be spun off, as 61% of respondents reported divestiture activity was reduced or deferred in the prior 12 months.  However, the report suggests “an increasing emphasis [on] refocusing, restructuring and reorganizing…particularly in terms of analyzing the appropriateness of acquisitions made in the last 10 years.”

iStockAnalyst’s editor supports this outlook. “There are three principal reasons why I believe we may see more divestitures by conglomerate businesses.  First, interest rates and the financial environment are comparatively benign across the world while the operating environment and the ability to squeeze more from customers are relatively not so benign. So it makes sense for conglomerate businesses to divest low profit/or high capital intensive businesses and invest those proceeds in high profit/low capital intensive businesses. Second, it doesn't make much sense for a conglomerate to hold on to a business which it can't successfully defend against the competition. Third, the stock market shows a tendency to undervalue the stocks of conglomerate businesses. This will not be much of a problem when the stock markets are on the rise, but it will affect the conglomerates financial profile when stock markets are uncertain or when they are in the bear grip.“

The KPMG and The Deal survey was also bullish on 2010’s divestiture environment.  Those who foresaw an activity boost said, “…the primary reason for holding this opinion was that corporations continue to desire to sell off noncore or non-performing businesses.”  Strategics will be the primary acquirers of these divested assets, according to 56% of the participants, thanks to continued tightness in the credit markets and corporations’ willingness to offer higher multiples.  

The results are in
Deloitte’s data does in fact indicate increased divestiture activity for the first half of 2010.   Divestiture M&A News reports that from 1H 2009 to 1H 2010 the total value of divestiture transactions increased nearly 60 percent, driven by a higher average size for divestitures of 35 percent. 

The hurdles they overcame
The growth in completed divestitures is even more impressive considering the challenges in the current economic climate.  Unlike three to five years ago when capital was flowing freely, strategics and lenders now perform more exhaustive due diligence, requiring more access and greater information.  Add to these hindrances the rise of a valuation gap between buyers and sellers, and you begin to get a sense of a difficult environment for any transaction.  PricewaterhouseCoopers’ article, “Divestitures in Difficult Times” reiterates this idea: “The demand by potential buyers for increased access and information was seen as a driver of the extended time frames, again consistent with the limitations of credit and valuation gap that are driving the behavior of buyers.”

Further underscoring the impressive number of divestitures is the fact that divesting of a company is not something corporations are very adept at doing.  According to PwC’s survey, 46% of companies said their acquisition process was better defined than their divestiture process; and 39% said they had no formal pre-divestiture review process at all.  Additionally, unlike selling standalone entities, respondents said two of the top difficulties with divestitures are separating the business from the parent and producing carve out financial statements / recasting historical data.

Race review
The year-to-date rise in divestitures was far from a sure a bet.  Despite continuing challenges, the percentage of divestitures has risen at a faster pace than total deal volume and value.  If the trends of the first half of 2010 continue, this will become even more the case.  In fact, a recent Intralinks / mergermarket report on the global M&A market states that 90% of the 160 senior M&A professionals surveyed predict North America’s corporate restructuring to either increase or remain the same in the next twelve months.
